# üëã Hi there

I'm Matheus Streisky, software developer and technology enthusiast. I currently work as a Software Developer at Phillips Brasil.
With more than 4 years of experience in the area, I had the opportunity to work on several interesting projects and explore different technologies.

# ‚òØ Expertise

Always thinking about the best user experience, I specialized in back-end development, combining modern frameworks with design patterns and good programming practices. With almost 5 years of experience, I have always been improving my back-end skills, developing customized functionalities for clients, carrying out migrations between databases and always maintaining the highest standards of performance and security in back-end systems.

In my professional career, I worked as a developer and analyst and also led and guided interns and juniors in the companies where I worked. I have always tried to be the highlight of my team, delivering robust and high-performance features to customers, always maintaining good code maintenance for developers.

Outside of the professional environment, I am passionate about games, especially RPGs. However, I always find time to study and improve my skills more and more.
